# SyntaxFlex

UPDATE (12 JULY, 2018): As of now, we will be expanding this project outside of python. We are/will be starting one for C++/C and JAVA.

Thanks for using SyntaxFlex!
My mission is to make it easier for cultures in which English is not their dominate language be able to program. SyntaxFlow is for anybody, whether you want to change the syntax of your programming language, or your programming languages available in multiple languages. It truly is up to you.

Currently, Python is the only programming language out for use. It is still in Beta.

Please keep in mind that SyntaxFlex is still in beta! If you encounter any bugs are problems, please tell me!
